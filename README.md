4.  3.   img element - `<img>` is the tag, and it needs to have `alt` attribute. `alt` attribute is for accessibility, if incase image is not loaded, then text in alt attribute is displayed
5.  4. anchor element - `<a>` allows to access external content, `href` attribute contains hyperlink to external content, and text within anchor element allows user to click
6.  5. internal linking with `#` : for any html element, we can add attribute as `id` and use this attribute to refer to this html element. And using anchor html element, we can use `href` attribute to point to `#id` of any other html element. This will help in navigating from one section of the html document to another. Internal linking will be helpful , when the document is huge and not visible at once within the device viewport, for example.
